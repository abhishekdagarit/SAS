# More SAS Questions

1. WHAT SIZE OF DATASETS DO YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH? WHAT TOOLS DO YOU USE TO DEAL WITH LARGE DATASETS?

Everyone has a different impression of what is considered a large dataset. Even if a candidate hasn’t worked with large datasets, they should be able to come up with some creative answers. The complexity and variations to this question will give you a pretty good feel for the candidate’s skill level with SAS datasets whether it fits your needs in this area

2. WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JANUARY 1ST, 1960?

This is a nice transition question. A candidate past Beginner should be able to answer this question with ease.

3. WHICH SAS PROCEDURES (PROCS) DO YOU USE AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE?

This is a very Open question. An experienced programmer will be able to list a dozen procedures. A beginner or intermediate candidate may only list about five and then start repeating themselves. The complexity and variation of the procs mentioned will give you a good bit of insight. I recommend letting the candidate list all the procs they would like. Then go back over a few of the procedures and ask for what purpose they were used. This will flush out the ones that may be “fluff” answers rather than actual procs they have experience with.

5. DESCRIBE YOUR FAMILIARITY WITH SAS FORMATS/INFORMATS.

There is a wide range of answers to this question. A beginner will usually list some date formats. Engage the candidate into when they use them and how. Ask the candidate whether he/she creates formats and if so, for what instances and by what methods. If a candidate only lists PROC FORMAT, then they tend to be on the less experienced side. Only an advanced/expert level candidate will be able to list other uses for formats and have used data steps and CNTLIN statements to create them.

6. DESCRIBE YOUR FAMILIARITY WITH SAS MACROS AND THE MACRO LANGUAGE.

This too is a wide open question. A beginner usually will know how to call macros and suggest they are used for procedures that are being repeated. A more advanced candidate should be able to carry on a lengthy conversation about macros, how they’re used, when they use them, and how to deal with code within macros.

10. FOR WHAT PURPOSES DO YOU USE DATA _NULL_?

Beginners to Intermediate might only suggest using DATA _NULL_ to create macro variables. A little more experience would have a programmer describing output to a flat file. They might also suggest outputting to html or other outside sources such as _webout. 

There are lots of responses here, combinations of answers rather than just one is truly where the skill level is flushed out.

Using SAS, combine Dataset A with Dataset B. Keep only those records that are contained in both A & B. 

Creativity rather than the perfect answer is being sought.

## Macro

1. What system options would you use to help debug a macro? 
2. Describe how you would create a macro variable. 
3. How do you identify a macro variable? 
4. How do you define the end of a macro? 
5. How do you assign a macro variable to a SAS variable? 
6. For what purposes have you used SAS macros?

9. If you use a SYMPUT in a DATA step, when and where can you use the macro variable? 
10. What do you code to create a macro? End one? 
11. Describe how you would pass data to a macro. 
12. You have five data sets that need to be processed identically; how would you simplify that processing with a macro? 
13. How would you code a macro statement to produce information on the SAS log? This statement can be coded anywhere. 
14. How do you add a number to a macro variable? 
15. If you need the value of a variable rather than the variable itself, what would you use to load the value to a macro variable? 
16. Can you execute a macro within a macro? Describe. 
17. Can you a macro within another macro? If so, how would SAS know where the current macro ended and the new one began? 
18. How are parameters passed to a macro?

## WRAPPING UP A TECHNICAL INTERVIEW

After all the questions you’ve prepared have been thoroughly explored and you feel you’ve gotten enough of theappropriate information to make a thorough assessment, allow the candidate some time to add additional informationthey feel may be of interest to you. Not only is this polite, occasionally there is interesting information gathered.

An experienced or savvy interviewer will be able to avoid too much feedback to the candidate during the interview. If the task is truly to extract technical skill level, letting the candidate know if they were right or wrong in response to questions should be avoided.
